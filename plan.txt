		- create iobject to store jobs
		
		-a job takes informatoin and some specific function.
		A job can be executed. It sends a request to a page and gets its contents.
		The custom function extracts a picture url. The universal picture crawler holds
		some functions for extracting imageUrls from img tags. The job specific implementation
		is responsible for extracting a little part of the whole html page which should contain the img.
		Cheers:
		
		
		the jobs are managed and started by 'Setup' class
		Classes::
		
		PicCrawler {
			-IntervalService
			+startJob(job: Job);
			
		}
		
		Parser {
			// extracts all urls within <img> tags and which end with .jpg, .png etc
			extractImageUrl(): string
		}
		
		Request {
			get() 
		}
		
		
		class {
			url: string;
			
		}
